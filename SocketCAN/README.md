# SocketCAN Demo and Adapter Setup
This demo consists of SocketCAN interface `can0` which is connected to SIL Kit via `SilKitAdapterSocketCAN`, with the latter being a SIL Kit participant connected to `CAN1` SIL Kit network. 
For demonstration purposes, another SIL Kit participant `CanEchoDevice` is connected to the same `CAN1` SIL Kit network.   

First, a virtual CAN interface (SocketCAN) is set up in Linux using a shell script. Then, the `SilKitAdapterSocketCAN` is launched, binding to the virtual CAN interface from one side and connecting to SIL Kit as a participant from the other. 
After that the `CanEchoDevice` is launched and its connection to SIL Kit is established. 
When all the connections are set up, a shell script is run to generate CAN payload on `can0` SocketCAN interface. 

The following sketch shows the general setup:

## CanEchoDevice

This demo application implements a very simple SIL Kit participant that connects to the SIL Kit `CAN1` network, to which both the SocketCAN Adapter and CANoe can connect as SIL Kit 
participants in order to exchange CAN frames. The `CanEchoDevice` responds to CAN messages it receives on `CAN1` network by incrementing the received CAN ID by `1` and shifitng the data field by one byte to the left, then sending it back on the same `CAN1` network.

# Running the Demos

## SocketCAN interface setup and CAN traffic generation in Linux
First, run the `OpenVCan_can0.sh` script in the Terminal, which will load the necessary Linux kernel modules and setup a virtual CAN interface named `can0`.

    sudo chmod +x SocketCAN/demos/shell_scripts/OpenVCan_can0.sh
    ./SocketCAN/demos/shell_scripts/OpenVCan_can0.sh

You should see this output that indicates that the `can0` virtual CAN device has been successfully launched:
    
    Device "can0" does not exist.
    Creating [can0] interface.
    vCAN interface [can0] is up & running.


Now, you can start sending virtual CAN frames from your terminal. 
This can be done with the following command
    
    cansend can0 123#AAAABBBB

**Note:** In this example: `can0` is the name of the virtual CAN interface, `123` is the CAN frame ID, `AAAABBBB` is the CAN transmitted data

**Note:** You might need to install the `can-utils` package in order to have the CAN-related command line tools like `cansend` & `candump`. You can do this with `sudo apt install can-utils`.

Run the SendSocketCANFrames.sh script to continuously generate a `001#AAAABBBB` CAN message (CAN ID = 001, Data=AAAABBBB) and send it through to `can0`.

    sudo chmod +x SocketCAN/demos/shell_scripts/SendSocketCANFrames.sh
    ./SocketCAN/demos/shell_scripts/SendSocketCANFrames.sh

As of now, a virtual CAN `can0` device is up and running and a `001#AAAABBBB` message is continuously being sent on it.

## Running the Demo Applications

Now is a good point to start the `sil-kit-registry`:

    ./path/to/SilKit-x.y.z-$ubuntu/SilKit/bin/sil-kit-registry --listen-uri 'silkit://0.0.0.0:8501'

After that, launch the SilKitAdapterSocketCAN

    ./bin/SilKitAdapterSocketCAN --configuration ./SocketCAN/demos/SilKitConfig_Adapter.silkit.yaml

You should see the following output in the terminal where the adapter was launched: 

    [date time] [SilKitAdapterSocketCAN] [info] Creating participant 'SilKitAdapterSocketCAN' at 'silkit://localhost:8501', SIL Kit version: 4.0.35
    [date time] [SilKitAdapterSocketCAN] [info] Connected to registry at 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8501' via 'tcp://127.0.0.1:38226' (silkit://localhost:8501)
    [date time] [SilKitAdapterSocketCAN] [info] Creating CAN controller 'SilKitAdapterSocketCAN_CAN_CTRL'
    [date time] [SilKitAdapterSocketCAN] [info] Creating CAN device connector for 'can0'
    [date time] [SilKitAdapterSocketCAN] [info] vCAN device successfully opened
    Press CTRL + C to stop the process...

You should see also a `SilKitAdapterSocketCAN` participant announcement in the SIL Kit registry terminal

    [date time] [SilKitRegistry] [info] Sending known participant message to SilKitAdapterSocketCAN

In a separate Terminal, launch the CanEchoDevice

    ./bin/SilKitDemoCanEchoDevice

You should see the following output in the terminal after launching the CanEchoDevice:

    Creating participant 'CanEchoDevice' at silkit://localhost:8501
    [date time] [CanEchoDevice] [info] Creating participant 'CanEchoDevice' at 'silkit://localhost:8501', SIL Kit version: 4.0.36
    [date time] [CanEchoDevice] [info] Connected to registry at 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8501' via 'tcp://127.0.0.1:35464' (silkit://localhost:8501)
    [date time] [CanEchoDevice] [info] Creating CAN controller 'CanEchoDevice_CAN1'
    Press CTRL + C to stop the process...

**Note:** You can launch `SilKitDemoCanEchoDevice` with `--log Debug` argument if you want to see the CAN payload traffic logs. 

You should also see a `CanEchoDevice` participant announcement in the SIL Kit registry terminal:

    [date time] [SilKitRegistry] [info] Sending known participant message to CanEchoDevice


### Monitoring CAN data generated on `can0` vCAN device  
You can read data that is available on the `can0` vCAN device. To do this you can use the following command in a separate Terminal:

    candump can0

If both the `SendSocketCANFrames.sh` script and the CanEchoDevice are running along with the SilKitAdapterSocketCAN, you should see output similar to the following in the terminal:
    
    can0  001   [4]  AA AA BB BB
    can0  002   [4]  AA BB BB 00
    can0  001   [4]  AA AA BB BB
    can0  002   [4]  AA BB BB 00
    . 
    .

As described earlier, CAN messages with ID of 001 are the ones sent from can0 (outgoing). On the other hand, the ones with ID 002 are being received on `can0`, these have been sent back from the CanEchoDevice after increasing ID by `1` and applying a shift-left of data by one byte. 


#### Adding CANoe (17 SP3 or newer) as a participant
If CANoe is connected to the SIL Kit, all CAN traffic is visible there as well. You can also execute a test unit which checks if the CAN messages are being transmitted as expected.

Before you can connect CANoe to the SIL Kit network you should adapt the `RegistryUri` in `/SocketCAN/demos/CANoe_SILKit_config.silkit.yaml` to the IP address of your system where your sil-kit-registry is running. 
The configuration file is referenced by both following CANoe use cases (Desktop Edition and Server Edition).

#### CANoe Desktop Edition
Load the `CANoe_vCAN_configuration.cfg` from the `demos/CANoe` directory and start the measurement. Optionally you can also start the test unit execution of included test configuration.
While the demo is running these tests should be successful.

#### CANoe4SW Server Edition (Windows)
You can also run the same test set with `CANoe4SW SE` by executing the following powershell script `demos/CANoe4SW_SE/run.ps1`. 
The test cases are executed automatically and you should see a short test report in powershell after execution.

#### CANoe4SW Server Edition (Linux)
You can also run the same test set with `CANoe4SW SE (Linux)`. At first you have to execute the powershell script `demos/CANoe4SW_SE/createEnvForLinux.ps1` on your windows system by using tools of `CANoe4SW SE (Windows)` to prepare your test environment for Linux. 
In `demos/CANoe4SW_SE/run.sh` you should adapt `canoe4sw_se_install_dir` to the path of your `CANoe4SW SE` installation in your Linux system. Afterwards you can execute `demos/CANoe4SW_SE/run.sh` in your Linux system. The test cases are executed automatically and you should see a short test report in your terminal after execution.


### Generating CAN data in CANoe Desktop Edition 
This is done with the same previous setup, but instead of generating CAN traffic on the vCAN device (in Linux, by running the `SendSocketCANFrames.sh` script ), CANoe Desktop Edition is the source of CAN payload.  

You can start generating CAN frames in CANoe Desktop Edition using the CanDemoPanel: 

![CanDemoPanel](demos/images/CanDemoPanel_screenshot.png)

After starting the measurement, click on the `Toggle sending` button to start sending CAN frames on SIL Kit CAN1 network. The outgoing CAN frames have an ID of `0C8` and hold `87 65 43 21` data.

You can read data that is available on the `can0` vCAN device

    candump can0

If the CanEchoDevice is running along with the SilKitAdapterSocketCAN, you should see output similar to the following in the terminal:
 
    can0  0C8   [4]  87 65 43 21
    can0  0C9   [4]  65 43 21 00
    can0  0C8   [4]  87 65 43 21
    can0  0C9   [4]  65 43 21 00
    . 
    .

As described earlier, CAN messages with ID of 0C8 are the ones sent from CANoe Desktop Edition and the ones with ID 0C9 are the response of the CanEchoDevice to those frames, after increasing their ID by `1` and applying a shift-left of data by one byte.
